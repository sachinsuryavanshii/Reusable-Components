we created a simple, modular Node.js project using reusable components and services. Hereâ€™s a summary of the reusable parts:

1) Logger Component: Used for centralized logging.
2) Validator Component: Validates user input.
3) UserService: Handles user-related logic and can be extended to interact with a real database.
4) Routes: Defines the API routes for users.
